                through many levels using skill alone. Ads are minimal and
                designed not to disrupt your experience. Our goal is to keep the

                You can play most parts of the game without an internet
                connection. Offline play allows you to enjoy single-player
                levels, daily challenges, and boosters. However, features like
                leaderboards and cloud saving require an active internet
                connection. When you go back online, your progress and
                leaderboard scores will sync automatically. This makes the game
                convenient for travel or when connectivity is limited.

                Your game progress is saved automatically on your device. For
                additional security and cross-device play, you can connect your

                syncing, allowing you to continue your game on multiple Android
                devices seamlessly. Be sure to log in before switching devices.
                If you uninstall and reinstall without cloud save, your progress

                If you run out of lives, you have several options. Lives
                regenerate over time, usually one every 15 minutes, so you can
                return to the game later. You may also watch optional rewarded
                ads to gain extra lives instantly. Alternatively, you can use
                in-game items or purchase additional lives. The system is

                Boosters are special tools that help clear the board or create
                combos. Examples include the Lollipop Hammer, which can smash a
                single candy, and the Rainbow Drop that clears all candies of
                one color. Boosters can be earned as rewards or purchased. Using
                boosters strategically is key to overcoming tougher levels. They
                add an extra layer of fun and tactical depth to the game.

                Combining special candies triggers powerful effects. For
                example, matching four candies might create a striped candy that
                clears a whole row or column. Matching five creates rainbow
                candies that can clear all candies of one color. These combos
                can clear large sections of the board and boost your score.
                Mastering combos is essential for beating harder puzzles
                efficiently.
